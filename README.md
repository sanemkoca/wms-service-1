# Task: Library Management System

### Description:
Develop a simple system for managing books in a library. The system should allow adding books, registering users, and enabling users to borrow and return books.

### Requirements:
- Implement a solution in PHP that models the management of books and users in a library.
- The solution should provide at least the following functionalities:
    * Adding and listing books.
    * Registering and managing users.
    * Borrowing and returning books.
- The solution should provide at least the following functionalities:
    * Adding and listing books.
    * Registering and managing users.
    * Borrowing and returning books.
- Ensure that the system maintains data integrity (e.g., a book cannot be borrowed by multiple users at the same time).
- The system should offer a straightforward way to display the current state of the library (available books, borrowed books, and
    users).
- #### Database Requirement:
    * You are required to submit a SQL schema if you decide to implement the system with a database.
    * Alternatively, you may also submit a solution that does not use a database (e.g., data stored in memory or in files).
  
### Guidelines:
- You are free to decide how to structure and architect the program (e.g., object-oriented, procedural, or functional).
- Make sure the code is well-structured and readable.
- Consider the reusability and extensibility of your code.
- Utilize concepts such as encapsulation, modularization, and data validation where appropriate.
- **_Focus_**: The focus of this task is on backend skills. A fancy layout or front-end design is not required. 

### Example Workflow (Optional):
- Adding multiple books to the library.
- Registering users.
- A user borrows and returns a book.
- Displaying the current state of the library.

### Objective:
This task is designed to assess your ability to design and implement a solution to a given problem. You have the freedom to choose the structure and paradigms you wish to use. The focus is on delivering a functional and well-structured solution within the given time. Additionally, if you choose to use a database, include the corresponding SQL schema with your submission.
